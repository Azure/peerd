This project implements peer to peer distribution of content (such as content-addressable files or OCI container images)
in a Kubernetes cluster. The source of the content could be another node in the same cluster, an OCI container registry
(like Azure Container Registry) or a remote blob store (such as Azure Blob Storage).

#### Important Disclaimer

This is **work in progress** and not yet production ready. We are actively working on this project and would love to
hear your feedback. Please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Quickstart

To see all available commands, run `make help`.

### Deploy Peerd to Your Cluster Using Helm

If you have a k8s cluster that uses containerd as the runtime, you can use the provided [helm chart] to deploy Peerd
pods on every node. With containerd, Peerd leverages the [hosts configuration][containerd hosts] to act as a mirror for
container images.

```bash
CLUSTER_CONTEXT=<your-cluster-context> && \
  TAG=<docker-image-tag> && \
  helm --kube-context=$CLUSTER_CONTEXT install --wait peerd ./build/package/peerd-helm \
    --set peerd.image.ref=ghcr.io/azure/acr/dev/peerd:$TAG
```

By default, `mcr.microsoft.com` and `ghcr.io` are mirrored, but this is configurable. For example, to mirror `docker.io`
as well, run the following.

```bash
CLUSTER_CONTEXT=<your-cluster-context> && \
  TAG=<docker-image-tag> && \
  helm --kube-context=$CLUSTER_CONTEXT install --wait peerd ./build/package/peerd-helm \
    --set peerd.image.ref=ghcr.io/azure/acr/dev/peerd:$TAG
    --set peerd.hosts="mcr.microsoft.com ghcr.io docker.io"
```

On deployment, each Peerd instance will try to connect to its peers in the cluster. 

* When connected successfully, each pod will generate an event `P2PConnected`. This event is used to signal that the 
  Peerd instance is ready to serve requests to its peers.

* When an instance serves a request by downloading data from a peer, it will emit an event called `P2PActive`, 
  signalling that it's actively communicating with a peer and serving data from it.

To see logs from the Peerd pods, run the following.

```bash
kubectl --context=$CLUSTER_CONTEXT -n peerd-ns logs -l app=peerd -f
```

### Observe Metrics

Peerd exposes metrics on the `/metrics/prometheus` endpoint. Mmetrics are prefixed with `peerd_`. `libp2p` metrics are
prefixed with `libp2p_`.

#### Examples on a 5 node AKS cluster, node sizes: `Standard_D2s_v3` and `Standard_D8ds_v5`

## Features

* **Peer to Peer File Sharing**: Peerd allows a node to act as a mirror for files obtained from any HTTP upstream source
  (such as an [Azure Blob] using a [SAS URL]), and can discover and serve a specified byte range of the file to/from
  other nodes in the cluster. Peerd will first attempt to discover and serve this range from its peers. If not found, it
  will  fallback to download the range from the upstream URL. Peerd caches downloaded ranges as well as optionally, can
  prefetch the entire file.

  With this facility, `peerd` can be used as the [p2p proxy] for [Overlaybd].

  ```json
  "p2pConfig": {
    "enable": true,
    "address": "localhost:30000/blobs"
  }
  ```

* **Peer to Peer Container Image Sharing**: Pulling a container image to a node in Kubernetes is often a time consuming
  process, especially in scenarios where the registry becomes a bottleneck, such as deploying a large cluster or scaling
  out in response to bursty traffic. To increase throughput, nodes in the cluster which already have the image can be
  used as an alternate image source. Peerd subscribes to events in the containerd content store, and advertises local
  images to peers. When a node needs an image, it can query its peers for the image, and download it from them instead
  of the registry. Containerd has a [mirror][containerd hosts] facility that can be used to configure Peerd as the 
  mirror for container images.

The APIs are described in the [swagger.yaml].
